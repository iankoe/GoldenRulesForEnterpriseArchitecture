# Golden Rules For Enterprise Architecture

An architectural golden rule is a "commandment", adherence to which leads to higher long-term value for an Asset. The set of golden rules is part of Enterprise Architecture Governance. The Golden Rules and the principles that organize them are not limited to a single company/team/division or product. In fact, the architecture principles and associated golden rules specifically capture the non-functional requirements that every product needs to adhere to, but which business requirements often assume rather than specify.

The principles are categorized at different levels and grouped into high level business objectives as follows:

* **Safe** - Level 1 Governance
