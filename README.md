# Principle based Enterprise Architecture

An architectural golden rule is a "commandment", adherence to which leads to higher long-term value for an Asset. The set of golden rules is part of Enterprise Architecture Governance. The Golden Rules and the principles that organize them are not limited to a single company/team/division or product. In fact, the architecture principles and associated golden rules specifically capture the non-functional requirements that every product needs to adhere to, but which business requirements often assume rather than specify.
