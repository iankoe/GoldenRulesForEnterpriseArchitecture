# Principle based Enterprise Architecture

Enterprise Architecture shoudl not be Ad-hoc.  It shoudl be basedon principles and it should be measurable.

The golden rules organized by *architecture principles*, which are in turn organized by **business objectives**.  These collectively define the non-functional requirements that every system ought to embrace, but which business requirements often assume rather than specify.
